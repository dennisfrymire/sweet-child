    {title: 'Moon River', artist: 'Frank Ocean', album: 'Someone Great', lyrics: `[Intro]
    One, two
    
    [Chorus]
    Moon river, wider than a mile
    I'm crossing you in style someday
    A dream maker (maker)
    My heart (you heart) breaker
    Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' that way (the same)
    
    [Refrain]
    Two drifters off to see the world
    There's such a crazy world to see
    We're all chasin' after all the same
    Chasin' after our ends
    
    [Chorus]
    Moon river, wider than a mile
    Crossin' in style someday
    My dream maker, heartbreaker
    Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' the same
    
    [Refrain]
    Two drifters off to see the world
    It's such a crazy world you'll see
    What I see, who I become
    What I see, who I become
    We're all chasin' after our ends
    Chasin' after our ends`, image: 'https://i.redd.it/xr0ushtud4h01.jpg', vid_link: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXiFHDfvn4A'}
    {title: 'Blackbird', artist: 'The Beatles', album: 'The Beatles', lyrics: `Blackbird singing in the dead of night
    Take these broken wings and learn to fly
    All your life
    You were only waiting for this moment to arise
    Blackbird singing in the dead of night
    Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
    All your life
    You were only waiting for this moment to be free
    Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
    Into the light of a dark black night
    Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
    Into the light of a dark black night
    Blackbird singing in the dead of night
    Take these broken wings and learn to fly
    All your life
    You were only waiting for this moment to arise
    You were only waiting for this moment to arise
    You were only waiting for this moment to arise`, image: 'https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000144929417-74n783-t500x500.jpg', vid_link: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Man4Xw8Xypo'}
    {title: 'A Bushel and a Peck', artist: 'Doris Day', album: 'Guys and Dolls', lyrics: `I love you a bushel and a peck
    A bushel and a peck and a hug around the neck
    A hug around the neck and a barrel and a heap
    A barrel and a heap and I'm talkin' in my sleep
    About you, about you
    'Cause I love you a bushel and a peck
    You bet your purdy neck I do
    A doodle oodle oh
    A doodle oodle oodle oh doo
    I love you a bushel and a peck
    A bushel and a peck though you make my heart a wreck
    Make my heart a wreck and you make my life a mess
    Make my life a mess, yes a mess of happiness
    About you, about you
    'Cause I love you a bushel and a peck
    You bet your purdy neck I do
    A doodle oodle ooh doo
    A doodle oodle oodle ooh doo
    I love you a bushel and a peck
    A bushel and a peck and it beats meâ€¦`, image: 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/813gltHpGEL._SS500_.jpg', vid_link: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoVt12EyzKw'}
    {title: 'Mustang Sally', artist: 'Wilson Pickett', album: 'The Wicked Pickett' , lyrics: `Mustang Sally, think you better slow your mustang down
    Mustang Sally, think you better slow your mustang down
    You been running all over the town now
    Oh! I guess I'll have to put your flat feet on the ground
    All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally, ride
    All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally, ride
    All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally, ride
    One of these early mornings, oh, you gonna be wiping your weeping eyes
    I bought you a brand new mustang 'bout nineteen sixty five
    Now you come around signifying a woman, you don't want to let me ride
    Mustang Sally, think you better slow your mustang down
    You been running all over the town now
    Oh! I guess I'll have to put your flat feet on the ground
    All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally, ride
    All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally, ride
    All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally, ride`, image: 'https://playmoss.com/uploads/images/t/r/a/track_219043.jpg', vid_link: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16u6w0cjjrU'}

    {title: `Where Your Eyes Don't Go`, artist: 'They Might Be Giants', album: '', lyrics: `Where your eyes don't go a filthy scarecrow waves its broomstick arms
    And does a parody of each unconscious thing you do
    When you turn around to look it's gone behind you
    On its face it's wearing your confused expression
    Where your eyes don't go
    Where your eyes don't go a part of you is hovering
    It's a nightmare that you'll never be discovering
    You're free to come and go or talk like Kurtis Blow
    But there's a pair of eyes in back of your head
    Every jumbled pile of person has a thinking part that wonders
    What the part that isn't thinking isn't thinking of
    Should you worry when the skull head is in front of you
    Or is it worse because it's always waiting where your eyes don't go?
    Where your eyes don't go a part of you is hovering
    It's a nightmare that you'll never be discovering
    You're free to come and go or talk like Kurtis Blow
    But there's a pair of eyes in back of your head
    Where your eyes don't go a filthy scarecrow waves its broomstick arms
    And does a parody of each unconscious thing you do
    When you turn around to look it's gone behind you
    On its face it's wearing your confused expression
    Where your eyes don't go`, image: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3d/TheyMightBeGiants-ThenTheEarlierYears.jpg', vid_link: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro_u6AhcGYo'}
