# Sweet Child of Mine

A CRUD app that allows parents (or folks caring for young children) to find songs that aren’t lullabies or children’s songs, but are suitable for bedtime or for soothing.

## User Stories

As a user I want to be able to...

- Search for songs by title, artist or genre, and have returned results with this information, plus lyrics and an external link to a performance of the song. 

- Submit my own songs, or submit alternate (more kid-friendly or kid-centric) lyrics to existing entries. 

## MVP

- Rails backend feeding to React frontend a database that users can access, add to, update or delete.

## Stretch goals

- Make information searchable by certain criteria - song title, artist, etc.

- Portfolio-quality styling, with responsive CSS design.

- Have an embedded YouTube video with each entry that features a performance or example of the song.
